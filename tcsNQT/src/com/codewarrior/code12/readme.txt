Q.12)

Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places in the alphabet.
Spaces and non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
Problem Statement
 You are given a plaintext string and a shift key for encryption using the Caesar cipher. Your task is to shift each letter in the input text by the given key value.


Input Format
A single line containing the plaintext (may include uppercase, lowercase letters, and spaces).
An integer representing the shift key.
Output Format
Print the encrypted text after applying the Caesar cipher.
Constraints
1 ≤ key ≤ 25
The plaintext will contain only English letters and spaces (no digits or special characters).
Length of plaintext ≤ 1000.
Example
 Input:
All the best
1
Output:  Bmm uif cftu
Input:
