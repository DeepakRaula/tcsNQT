Mikes likes to play with numbers. His friends are also good with numbers and often plays mathematical games. They made a small game where they will spell the last digit of a factorial of a number other than 0. Let say the given number is 5, so 5! (5 factorial) will be
5 *4* 3* 2* 1= 120.
Here 0 is the last digit. But, we don't want 0, we want a
number other than 0.
Then the last digit is 2. This is what we have to output

Example 1:
Input
5 ->Input number
Output
2->last non-zero digit


Explanation:

Input number is 5, so 5!=120. The last nonzero digit is 2. And this is the output.

Example 2

Input:
9-> Input number.

Output:
8-> last non-zero digit

Explanation:
Input number is 9, so 9!=362880. The last nonzero digit is 8. And this is the output.

Constraints:
•1<=input number<105
•Only integers
The candidate has to write the code to accept 2 input(s)
•First input-Accept the value of integer

The output format for testing
•The output is the last nonzero digit, of a factorial of the input number (Checks the output in Example 1, Example 2).
Additional messages in output will cause the failure of test cases.
