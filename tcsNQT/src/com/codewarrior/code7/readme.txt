Q.7)

Reduce to one
Problem Statement
You are given an integer N. Your task is to print the minimum number of operations required to reduce N to 1. You can perform the following operations in any order:
• Divide N by X, where X<N and N%X =0.
• Subtract 1 from N.

Input Format:
The input consist of a single line:
• The line contains an integer N.
Output Format:
Print the minimum number of operations required to reduce N to 1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9


Example:
Input: 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
Perform 1st operation by taking X as 2 (which is less than 4 and 4%2 is 0), after performing the operation new N will be 2(4/2) , 1(2-1).

Input: 3
Output:  2
