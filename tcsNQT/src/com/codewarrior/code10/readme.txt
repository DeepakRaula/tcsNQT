Q.10)

Maximum Product
Given two ranges (L1, R1) and (L2, R2). You need to find two numbers a and b, such that L1 ≤ a ≤ R1 and L2 ≤ b ≤ R2, and the product of a and b is maximum

Input Format:
The input consists of a single line:
The line contains four space separated integers denoting L1, R1, L2, and R2 respectively.
Output Format:
Print the maximum product of a and b

Constraints:
-10^3 ≤ L1 ≤ R1 ≤ 10^3
-10^3 ≤ L2 ≤ R2 ≤ 10^3

Example:
Input: 1 3 -2 6
Output: 18
Explanation:
The ranges are (1, 3) and (-2, 6). So the maximum product of a, b such that

Sample Input : 1 2 3 4
Sample Output: 8
