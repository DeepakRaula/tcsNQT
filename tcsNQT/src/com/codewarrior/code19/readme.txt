Given a string Str, which contains numbers (0 to 9)and also letters of the English (‘A’ to 'Z'). The task is to reverse the string in such a way that the positions of numbers in the string are left unaltered.
Example 1:
Input:
a1b2igh3 -> Value of Str
Output:
h1g2iba3

Without changing the positions of 1, 2 and 3, only the positions of characters 'h', 'g, "i', 'b' and 'a' have been reversed.
 
Example 2:
Input:
Ab5c7de96 -> Value of Str
Output:
ed5c7bA96
